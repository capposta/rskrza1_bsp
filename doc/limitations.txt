    [DISPLAY (VDC5)]
        - Output device can be selected from following option.
          Default setting is CH0:LCD-KIT-B01, CH1:No output.
            - VDC5 CH0
                - No output
                - LCD-KIT-B01       (J10 connector of option board)
                - Analog RGB output (J15 connector of option board)
            - VDC5 CH1
                - No output
                - LCD-KIT-B01       (J12 connector of option board)
                - R0P7724EL0011RL   (J14 connector of option board)
                - Analog RGB output (J16 connector of option board)

        - Only the LCD-KIT-B01 connected to the J10 connector on the
          option board is supported as the output device,
        - Supported resolution is WXGA (800x480).
        - Pixel format in the frame buffer is aRGB8888, but a (alpha)
          is always 0xFF.
        - Output format to the LCD-KIT-B01 is RGB666.
        - The function either to change resolution or to adjust output
          video signal timing is not supported.
          So, when you use analog RGB output (J15 connector on the
          option board), the screen may not be displayed correctly
          even though you adjust the timing by the monitor.
        - Touch panel of the LCD-KIT-B01 is not supported.
        - When Linux boots, the following messages are shown, but
          operation of DISPLAY is not influenced.
          "(null): vdc5fb.1: channel 1 is turned off"

        - In using the channel 1 of VDC5, there are the following
          limitations.
            - Jumper switch or DIP switch settings are needed to use CH1.
              Please refer to uses manual of option board.
            - Following device can't be used simultaneously because of some of
              the signal lines are conflicted.
            - Since some signal lines conflicts, the following interfaces or
              devices cannot be used with VDC5 CH1.
                - LAN interface (ETHER interface)
                   SD card interface
                   NOR flash memory2

    [PWM]
        - Use MTU2 CH4.
        - PWM output port is P3_8.
        - Can't be used with NAND Flash or MMC.
        - Only tested using LCD Backlight Control I/F(/sys/class/backlight).
        - When "period" and a "duty" preset value are made into a long cycle 
          (ms order), the difference between a preset value and an output 
          waveform becomes large. 
          However, since the duty ratio (duty/period) which determines luminosity 
          in the case of the brilliance control use of LCD Backlight becomes 
          equivalent to the ratio of a preset value, it is satisfactory.

    [UIO(JCU)]
        - JPEG encoding is not supported.
        - Supported output format is only ARGB8888(32bit)
          (Alpha ch is fixed to 0xFF.)
