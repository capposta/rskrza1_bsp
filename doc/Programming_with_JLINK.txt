Programming the Serial SPI Flash with the Segger JLINK

The RZ/A1 RSK kit comes with a Segger Lite JTAG Adapter. In the directory

	Extra/J-Link_QSPI_Program

are programming scripts to program binary images that you build into on-board serial
flash (Dual SQPI).

Simply copy the resulting binaries from your builds into this directory and rename
them to end in ".bin" (overwritting the existing ones).

The individual binaries from the build.sh process can be found at these locations:

	rskrza1_bsp/output/u-boot-2013.04/u-boot.bin
	rskrza1_bsp/output/linux-3.14/arch/arm/boot/uImage
	rskrza1_bsp/output/linux-3.14/arch/arm/boot/xipImage (for XIP builds)
	rskrza1_bsp/output/linux-3.14/arch/arm/boot/dts/r7s72100-rskrza1.dtb
	rskrza1_bsp/output/buildroot-2014.05/output/images/rootfs.squashfs

The J-Link_QSPI_Program directory contains scripts for both Linux and Windows. Both
scripts perform the same operations and display detailed instructions.

	  LINUX: Program_QSPI.sh
	WINDOWS: Program_QSPI.bat

You will need to program all of the individual binary images to boot the kernel (except
for the fact that you will choose only uImage or xipImage as your kernel binary)

NOTE: Whenever you program the SPI Flash using this method, you will need to remove
power from the board to reset it (just using the RESET button will not work).
However, you may program multiple images (run the BATCH file multiple times) without
having to power cycle between each program session.
