Programming the Serial SPI Flash with the Segger JLINK

The RZ/A1 RSK kit comes with a Segger Lite JTAG Adapter. In the directory
	Extra/J-Link_QSPI_Program
of this BSP are DOS scripts to program the images that you built into on-board serial
flash (Dual SQPI).

Simply copy the resulting binaries from your builds into this directory and rename
them to end in ".bin" (overwritting the existing ones).

The individual binaries from the build.sh process can be found at these locations:

	rskrza1_bsp/output/u-boot-2013.04/u-boot.bin
	rskrza1_bsp/output/linux-3.14/arch/arm/boot/uImage
	rskrza1_bsp/output/linux-3.14/arch/arm/boot/xipImage (for XIP builds)
	rskrza1_bsp/output/linux-3.14/arch/arm/boot/dts/r7s72100-rskrza1.dtb
	rskrza1_bsp/output/buildroot-2014.05/output/images/rootfs.squashfs

Then from a Windows PC, execute the DOS batch file "Program_QSPI.bat" and follow the
directions on the screen.

You will need to program each of these to boot the kernel (except for the fact
that you will choose only uImage or xipImage as your kernel binary)

NOTE: Whenever you program the SPI Flash using this method, you will need to remove
power from the board to reset it (just using the RESET button will not work).
However, you may program multiple images (run the BATCH file multiple times) without
having to power cycle between each program session.
