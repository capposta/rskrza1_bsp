Linux kernel booting

If all the defaults of this BSP were used to build the images, and you used the JLINK
programming scripts in the Extra directory to program the serial SPI flash, you may
use the follow commands in u-boot to boot your board.


# Boot the uImage kernel image
# The external SDRAM will be used for system memory (default)

=> run s_boot


# Boot the xipIamge kernel image
# Kernel will run directly from QUAD SPI Flash and internal chip RAM will used
# for system memory.

=> run x_boot


File system login will be "root" (no password)
