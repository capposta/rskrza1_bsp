= Known issues and notes.

[U-Boot]

[Linux]
	[ rskrza1_deconfig ]
	- The defualt configuration does not have all BSP driver enabled by default.
	Please server to 'doc/kernel_drivers.txt' for a complete list of drivers
	and how to enable/disable them.

	[ XIP ]
	- The rskrza1_xip_defconfig removes support for many drivers to save on RAM.
	- The LCD is enabled, so 1.5MB of the internal RAM is reseved for the LCD
	frame buffer.

	[ SPIBSC ]
	- When this driver is enabled and used for ch0, the RESET button the RSK board
	does not work and you must remove power from the board to properly reset.
	- The Spansion driver was modifed specifically for the SPIBSC driver becuase the SPIBSC
	driver was written to intercept normal READ/WRITE command and convert them into QUAD
	commands, but when the Spansion send a quad command the SPIBSC driver doesn't know
	what to do with them.
	- This driver cannot be used (for ch0) while in XIP mode becase that channel
	is being used to fetch kernel code.


	[I2C]
	- The native RIIC driver that comes with the 3.14 kernel did not work right, so another
	I2C driver devleope by Renesas was used in this BSP.

	[ UIO/ JPEG ]
	- The JPEG userspace sample driver/app (librzjpeg) requires a 1MB buffer in internal RAM
	(see board-rskrza1.c). Therefore, it is disabled in the XIP configuration.
