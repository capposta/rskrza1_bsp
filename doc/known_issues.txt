= Known issues

    [U-Boot]
        - When write data which is not 4 byte aligned to serial flash,
          unexpected 1 to 3 byte data are written after the correct data to
          align 4 byte.
        - When read "4*n + 3" byte data, last 3 byte data are incorrect.

    [Linux]
        - [ADC]
            The values captured by ADC are not correct because of the LSI's
            known bug. This issue will be fixed by using LSI WS2.0(2nd-cut).
        - [USB Host]
            Following issues are occurred when use some specific USB
            memories.
              RUF-C256M/U2   :Error or hang up while kernel boots
        - [DISPLAY(VDC5)]
            If you use analog RGB connector(J15) as output device,
            strong flicker occurs when it displays fine checkered pattern and
            so on. This issue may be better by adjusting timing of video
            signal. Please refer to users manual.
        - [I2C]
            When writing multiple bytes into EEPROM by eeprog,
            a write error occurs.
