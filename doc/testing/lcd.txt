        Board HW: LCD Panel that comes with the RSK
             Bus: VDC5 ch0


NOTES:
Requires .config to have
	CONFIG_FB=y
	CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y

Also, enabling "CONFIG_LOGO=y" adds the penguin image at the top during boot.

TESTS:

When booting the kernel, watch the boot log text that comes out the serial port get
mirrored to the LCD screen. This is done by adding "115200 console=tty0" to the 
bootargs. Example:
	bootargs = 'console=ttySC2,115200 console=tty0'
