Serial Port Setup

You will need a serial port connection between the board and the PC.
The RSK board has an USB-to_Serial device already mounted, so you only need
to connect the USB cable that comes with the kit to between connector CN18 and
your PC.

	baudrate    :115200 bps
	data        :     8 bit
	parity      :  none
	stop        :     1 bit
	flow control:  none


Linux:
Linux will already have native support for this USB-to-Serial converter.
It should show up as /dev/ttyACM0. Therefore, you can use it like:

	$ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200

	NOTE: minicom is not pre-installed, so you ahve to do a 'apt-get install minicom'
	NOTE: To close minicom, press Ctrl+A, then 'q'

Windows:
While windows nativly suports a CDC class driver, you will need to point it
to a .INF file. That INF file comes on the RZ/A1 RSK CD.
You can also find it in the BSP in the "Extra" directory.
