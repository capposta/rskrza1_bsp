NOTE: On later RSK builds, these issues were resolved, so you may not have to do any modifications.

================================================
ENABLE ETHERNET
================================================
To use Ethernet, RSK+RZA1H board configuration must be changed  by modifying link registers.

	R104 : Fit -> Remove
	R105 : Remove -> Fit

Please refer to [6.1.8 Ethernet] of "RZ/A1H Group Renesas Starter Kit+  User's Manual For DS-5" for details. 

The two resistors are right on the corner of the RZ chip between the silk screen text for IC1 and a Tantalum capacitor next to silk screen marking for IC20. 

They are located together â€“ the only two resistors in this area.

================================================
REMOVE SD CARD DATA LINE PULL DOWN
================================================
During board manufacturing, a 0-Ohm resistor was populated when it was not supposed to be.

Resistor R92 Needs to be removed.

It is located on the bottom of the board near the CN1 card socket.
