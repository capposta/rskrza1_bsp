Building

To build this BSP, please open a terminal window in Linux and change into the base
directory of this BSP. From there, type:

	./build.sh

This will show you your options on what you can build.
For best results, run each build stage one at a time in the order they
appeared in the help message.


You may continue to use the build.sh script for individual component development.
For example, to add/remove kernel driver support, you can run:
	$ ./build.sh kernel menuconfig

Or to add more software packages to your root file system:
	$ ./build.sh buildroot menuconfig



To build the XIP version of the kernel, run the following (instead of
the defualt "./build.sh kernel")
	$ ./build.sh kernel rskrza1_xip_defconfig
	$ ./build.sh kernel xipImage
